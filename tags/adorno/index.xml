      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I say something I use words, but the words do not necessarily &lt;em&gt;get at&lt;/em&gt; what I am trying to say. They are placeholders, frames, that are part of an attempt to connect my mind and the world for a given purpose. The world is obviously here and I am obviously &lt;em&gt;in it&lt;/em&gt; saying something &lt;em&gt;about it&lt;/em&gt;, but the words nonetheless do not fully capture the world. Otherwise, there would simply be no distinction between mind and world. Although the subject (mind) and the object (world) form a whole, they are distinct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- more --&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-dog-is-in-the-backyard&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;My dog is in the backyard&amp;rdquo;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I say, &amp;ldquo;My dog is in the backyard,&amp;rdquo; I am shaping my own thoughts using concepts that are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; my own creation, but are, despite this, used by me &lt;em&gt;creatively&lt;/em&gt;. I am inculcated from birth into a language that is not my own. I may create an entirely new language, but it will nevertheless have been influenced by the concepts that originally formed me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The use of the word &amp;lsquo;dog&amp;rsquo; instantiates the concept &amp;lsquo;Dog&amp;rsquo;, but this concept is vague and filled in contextually depending on the circumstances of its use. For example, by using the adjective &amp;ldquo;my&amp;rdquo; along with &amp;ldquo;dog,&amp;rdquo; I add additional determinations to the concept &amp;lsquo;Dog&amp;rsquo;. It is not just any dog, but &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; dog. So, even if I didn&amp;rsquo;t know anything about the dog, I would know that the dog bears a particular relation to me. The word &amp;ldquo;the&amp;rdquo; in the context of &amp;ldquo;the backyard&amp;rdquo; indicates not just any backyard, but &lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; backyard where &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; dog is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this, the words that express concepts are imprecise on their own. The &lt;em&gt;pragmatics&lt;/em&gt; of language-use seem to be as crucial as their &lt;em&gt;semantics&lt;/em&gt;. What I am doing with the words and in what context is as important as the words themselves. Going further, when we appeal to dictionary definitions (i.e., lexical meanings), this is itself a pragmatic constraint on the semantics: &amp;ldquo;When I use this word I want you to consider its meaning as being tightly linked to this definition.&amp;rdquo; If lexical meaning are determined by use, then it seems that dictionary definitions and language-use are in a cyclical feedback relation. We codify linguistic behaviours and then these guide, but do not determine our future language use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Donald Davidson makes a point of highlighting instances in which language use &lt;em&gt;goes wrong&lt;/em&gt; in order to clarify the fact that lexical meaning is only a part of what we draw from when we communicate. For example, let&amp;rsquo;s say I mistakenly utter, &amp;ldquo;My &lt;em&gt;drog&lt;/em&gt; is in the backyard,&amp;rdquo; with the intention of conveying that &amp;lsquo;my &lt;em&gt;dog&lt;/em&gt; is in the backyard&amp;rsquo;. Despite my mistake in uttering the word &amp;ldquo;dog,&amp;rdquo; there is nevertheless a likelihood, given the right circumstances (e.g., that my interlocutor knows the english language, knows what the word &amp;ldquo;dog&amp;rdquo; means, and knows that I have a dog), that my interlocutor will correctly interpret me as meaning &amp;lsquo;My &lt;em&gt;dog&lt;/em&gt; is in the backyard&amp;rsquo;. This implies that language use can diverge from the strict &lt;em&gt;form&lt;/em&gt; of terms without affecting meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we can adjust for deviations in form to generate the intended meaning of an utterance, then perhaps there is a &lt;em&gt;relatively&lt;/em&gt; stable lexical meaning, after all. However, this possibility is challenged when we examine how words can be used in novel ways or metaphorically. For example, let&amp;rsquo;s say I live in an apartment block that does not have a backyard, but has a municipal park behind it. I simply refer to this park as my &amp;ldquo;backyard,&amp;rdquo; despite it not fulfilling the standard conditions of the lexical meaning of &amp;ldquo;backyard.&amp;rdquo; As long as the contextual circumstances lead an interpreter to infer that when I say &amp;ldquo;backyard&amp;rdquo; I am referring to the municipal park, then I have used this word to generate meaning without strictly following the lexical meaning of the term. A similar thing can occur if I use the term metaphorically, such as if I say, &amp;ldquo;The world is my backyard.&amp;rdquo; While I am partially relying on lexical meaning, the context in which the word &amp;ldquo;backyard&amp;rdquo; is uttered indicates that there is more to what I am saying than could be gathered from referring to a dictionary. In fact, if I were to strictly interpret this statement according to the lexical meaning, what some people mean by &lt;em&gt;literal meaning&lt;/em&gt;, then this would generate an interpretive error as well as an implausible meaning for my statement. How could &lt;em&gt;the world&lt;/em&gt; be my backyard?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his writing on metaphor, Davidson insists that in interpreting metaphors people, in fact, identify the falsehood involved in the lexical reading of a metaphorical statement (e.g., &amp;ldquo;The world &lt;em&gt;is not&lt;/em&gt; a backyard!&amp;quot;) and then move onto more productive interpretations, metaphorical ones, in this case. While this two-step process may, in fact, occur in particular circumstances, I think it is too strong to assume that it is a necessity. There are some cases where metaphorical/creative/loose interpretations are assumed from the start, such as in the case of reading a poem or in the case of someone using a metaphor that is &lt;em&gt;nearly&lt;/em&gt; dead. It is also important to note that people can easily move from &amp;lsquo;metaphorical&amp;rsquo; to &amp;lsquo;literal&amp;rsquo; interpretations seamlessly. For example, while I may use &amp;ldquo;backyard&amp;rdquo; metaphorically to indicate &amp;ldquo;the world&amp;rdquo; in a specific context, there will likely be cases where the lexical meaning will be more relevant. If I say, &amp;ldquo;My dog is in the backyard,&amp;rdquo; one would hope that I am saying it is in an &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; backyard and not loose in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;social-practices-as-generative-constraints&#34;&gt;Social practices as generative constraints&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In generating meaning, language-use relies on, but is not &lt;em&gt;determined&lt;/em&gt; by lexical meaning and other linguistic standards. It is possible to imagine situations in which syntax and grammar are distorted, intentionally or otherwise, but an utterance still results in the successful communication of an intended meaning. So we can say with confidence that pragmatic factors also play a large role. While there are a number of ways to break these factors down, I will emphasize the primacy of &lt;em&gt;social practices&lt;/em&gt;. While we may refer to indexicals––words or phrases that &lt;em&gt;demand&lt;/em&gt; filling by contextual ingredients, such as time and place––as standalone pragmatic factors of language-use, there is an important sense in which these rely on underlying social practices to be effective. For example, if I say, &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;She&lt;/em&gt; is being silly &lt;em&gt;today&lt;/em&gt;,&amp;rdquo; the &amp;ldquo;she&amp;rdquo; and  &amp;ldquo;today&amp;rdquo; in the statement must be filled in with contextually salient information. In this case, &amp;ldquo;she&amp;rdquo; refers to my dog and &amp;ldquo;today&amp;rdquo; refers to the day that this statement was actually uttered. I could easily make the same statement in a different context and &lt;em&gt;mean&lt;/em&gt; something completely different. Although there aren&amp;rsquo;t specific rules that specify what indexical expressions &lt;em&gt;point to&lt;/em&gt;, our social practices provide us with guidance (e.g., conventions, habits, activities, and/or rates of success in determining meaning). Therefore, while there is use in distinguishing between pragmatic factors, there is an important sense in which social practices underpin these, at least partially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Social practices are, of course, not &lt;em&gt;sui generis&lt;/em&gt;, but dependent on a number of contingent factors, such as the environment, biology, and history. Moreover, a given social practice, may be dependent on another or many other social practices. The social practice of &amp;lsquo;playing poker&amp;rsquo; hinges on a variety of other social practices, such as those leading to the production of cards and so forth. Furthermore, while a social practice must involve intentional actions, the social practice itself may not be practiced intentionally––although in some cases it may have been originated through an intentional act. Finally, social practices necessarily entail relations between people. They often, if not always, entail other non-human relations (e.g., to the natural world, the built environment, etc&amp;hellip;).  In Marxism, there is an emphasis on &lt;em&gt;social relations&lt;/em&gt;, which may be seen as a way of situating social practices within an interconnected and interdependent whole––sometimes referred to as a &lt;em&gt;totality&lt;/em&gt;––that makes up a given society or system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Language-use is dependent on social practices, which are themselves dependent upon a variety of factors. Importantly, they are dependent on an interdependent system of social relations, which although involving intentional action is not itself dependent upon the specific intention &lt;em&gt;to undertake&lt;/em&gt; the practices implied by a given system of social relations. While social practices provide language-use with &lt;em&gt;necessary&lt;/em&gt; guidance to generate meaning in the first place, they do so by &lt;em&gt;constraining&lt;/em&gt; the way in which language-use expresses meaning. Flaunting social practices means risking a failure of meaning. While a metaphor may &lt;em&gt;land&lt;/em&gt; it does not do so necessarily––the existence of languishing poets is a case in point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;language-use-and-the-critique-of-capitalism&#34;&gt;Language-use and the critique of capitalism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Capital&lt;/em&gt;, vol.1 Marx states &amp;ldquo;&lt;em&gt;To the producers, therefore, the social relations between their private labours appear as what they are&lt;/em&gt;, i.e. they do not appear as direct social relations between persons in their work, but rather as material [dinglich] relations between persons and social relations between things&amp;rdquo; (emphasis added). This is often taken to mean that people in capitalism are exhibiting &amp;ldquo;false-consciousness,&amp;rdquo; that they are mistaken in their understanding of the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; social relations. However, as noted by many, this portrayal of the situation gets something &lt;em&gt;very wrong&lt;/em&gt;. People aren&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;mistaken&lt;/em&gt; about their views of social and material relations under capitalism. These &amp;ldquo;material relations between persons and social relations between things&amp;rdquo; are, in fact, the relations that drive peoples&#39; survival and demise. As Marx puts it, &amp;ldquo;they appear as what they are&amp;rdquo;! As one cannot flaunt the constraints on language use without risk, the stakes are even higher with the flaunting of social practices that generate your means of subsistence. While the particular social practices that amount to the given social relations are dependent upon and, therefore, appearances of, an more primary ontological substratum, these appearances, better viewed as &lt;em&gt;expressions&lt;/em&gt; of the substratum, have a &lt;em&gt;grip&lt;/em&gt; on the reality of those living them. Put differently, we have to &lt;em&gt;live through&lt;/em&gt; these appearances. It is disingenuous to suggest that people are &lt;em&gt;merely&lt;/em&gt; confused and could decide to behave differently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, it should not be overlooked that there &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a mistake to which everyone in capitalism is susceptible: the error of viewing the &amp;lsquo;inverted&amp;rsquo; social and material relations of capitalism as an &lt;em&gt;unmediated Given&lt;/em&gt;, a natural fact. This explains, in part, the tendency in economics and sociology to tackle only the &lt;em&gt;products&lt;/em&gt; of these social relations (e.g., price, supply/demand, socio-economic status, and education), rather than relations themselves. These products or facts are &lt;em&gt;&amp;lsquo;naturally&amp;rsquo;&lt;/em&gt; aligned with the specific practices that make up capitalist social relations. In turn, by referencing such facts, the social practices undergirding language-use are not put to under strain. Even in the case of &amp;lsquo;discovering&amp;rsquo; an economic &amp;lsquo;fact&amp;rsquo;––supply and demand, let&amp;rsquo;s say––this does not break with the pragmatics of language-use, those constrained by capitalist social relations, but rather &lt;em&gt;articulates&lt;/em&gt; them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since capitalist social relations are &lt;em&gt;treated&lt;/em&gt; as a Given, this means that any attempt to &lt;em&gt;critique&lt;/em&gt; such relations will be going against the grain of the relations themselves. When one critiques capitalism, one is faced with a problem comparable to using indexicals to &lt;em&gt;point at&lt;/em&gt; things in a non-standard fashion: &amp;ldquo;When &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; say &amp;lsquo;it&amp;rsquo; I do not mean the thing &amp;lsquo;it&amp;rsquo; usually means, but the thing that underlies &lt;em&gt;the thing &amp;lsquo;it&amp;rsquo; usually means&lt;/em&gt;.&amp;rdquo; Critique thus necessarily has a greater risk of failure in comparison to language-use in the idiom of classical and neo-classical economics––the realm of &amp;lsquo;immediate&amp;rsquo; social facts that takes this so-called immediacy as the warrant for their legitimacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difficulty in critique lies in mediating the apparent immediacy of capitalist social relations. Like an excessively esoteric metaphor, critique adds another step or layer to interpretation that must be taken into account––a direct attack on the principle of parsimony. More than difficult to undertake or absorb, critique proposes an idea that is at diametrically at odds with what is Given. It suggests that our words and concepts are, as Adorno states, &amp;ldquo;entwined with a non-conceptual whole.&amp;rdquo; Thus the challenge posed by critique comes across as a delusion––a gloomy misapprehension. Beyond this, while we are living through capitalism, the critique of capitalism must be undertaken with the linguistic social-practices &lt;em&gt;of capitalism&lt;/em&gt; that form us. Despite &lt;em&gt;attempts&lt;/em&gt; to do otherwise, if we critique capitalism, we are necessarily doing so from within. Immanent critique, in this sense, means dissolving the Givenness of capitalist social relations.
The apparent immediacy of capitalist social relations transforms what is, in fact, part of the subject––capitalist social relations––into a seeming object. Objectified social relations do not &lt;em&gt;pass&lt;/em&gt; as social relations, but as objects. The act of critique must, therefore, negate the negation of the objectified subject by pointing to the non-conceptual ground of capitalist social-relations, social relations as such. It must disclose how the &amp;lsquo;object&amp;rsquo; is a subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The one advantage provided by the objectification of the subject &lt;em&gt;for critique&lt;/em&gt; is that it is a standard feature of language-use to engage with the world, the object. Yet, as I said at the start of this post, despite a connection existing between the subject and object, there must also be a distinction. This distinction implies that language cannot contain the world as a whole, on pain of denying the world as such. Therefore, the necessary gap between subject and object provides a similar gap between &lt;em&gt;objectified&lt;/em&gt; social relations and the subject. The problem of the Giveness of capitalist social relations for critique also seems to &lt;em&gt;potentially&lt;/em&gt; provide its solution. In my view, Wilfrid Sellars&#39; understanding of the &amp;ldquo;scientific image&amp;rdquo; and language provides resources for exploiting this paradox in capitalist social relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;sellars-and-the-scientific-image&#34;&gt;Sellars and the scientific image&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like Adorno, Sellars argues there is an ontological surfeit that cannot be fully captured conceptually (i.e., through language-use). There must be a distinction between mind and world. Although he espouses naturalism, which may seem &lt;em&gt;prima facie&lt;/em&gt; at odds with Adorno, Sellars does not adopt a reductionist approach to science. For Sellars, certain normative concepts are irreducible to non-normative, scientific ones. Tied to his brand of naturalism, Sellars is also aligned with Adorno in terms of viewing appearances in a Hegelian light, as more than &lt;em&gt;mere&lt;/em&gt; illusions––as objectively existing expressions of an &amp;lsquo;essence&amp;rsquo; or substratum that have practical effects on our social practices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sellars makes an important distinction between the &amp;ldquo;manifest image&amp;rdquo; and the &amp;ldquo;scientific image.&amp;rdquo; Given that the manifest image also includes refined scientific thinking, the terminology is slightly misleading. Very briefly, the manifest image is the image in which humans first &amp;lsquo;encounter themselves&amp;rsquo;––when humans first &lt;em&gt;became&lt;/em&gt; &amp;lsquo;human&amp;rsquo;. In essence, it is the ground of conceptual thinking. However, as Sellars notes, conceptual thinking in the manifest image is dominated by viewing the things in its ontology as &lt;em&gt;persons&lt;/em&gt;, including non-human objects. Of course, Sellars doesn&amp;rsquo;t think that humans in the manifest image treat non-human objects and phenomena as &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; people, but rather that the non-human world can be &lt;em&gt;explained&lt;/em&gt; using normative and intentional concepts––concepts that hinge on standards of correctness/incorrectness. For Sellars, a deficiency of the manifest image is that it presupposes that the world cannot be explained outside of normative language-use. In fact, there is a sense in which the manifest images implies the full intelligibility of the world, since the world is, in principle conceptually articulated in normative terms. However, for Sellars, the ontological surfeit that escapes the grasp of normative concepts, gives rise to contradictions in the manifest image, which leads to its evolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the scientific image involves the &amp;ldquo;postulation of imperceptible entities, and principles pertaining to them, to explain the behaviour of perceptible things.&amp;rdquo; The go-to example of this type of concept-use is theoretical physics, such as when forces are postulated to explain the movement of bodies. The scientific image must, by necessity, use concepts normatively in the sense that even descriptive assertions are subject to normative standards of correctness––the concept-use and linguistic practices of the scientific image arise from the manifest image, after all. But unlike the manifest image, it attempts explanation in a non-intentional and non-normative manner. It postulates &lt;em&gt;non-person-like&lt;/em&gt; forces, objects, and phenomena to provide non-normative explanations, even including explanations of normative and conceptual aspects of our reality (e.g., how evolutions is often &lt;em&gt;clumsily&lt;/em&gt; used to explain all human behaviour).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientific image is not &lt;em&gt;sui generis&lt;/em&gt;, but necessarily arises out of and draws its resources from the manifest image. Conversely, the scientific image&amp;rsquo;s explanations are taken up by the manifest image. As Dionysis Christias argues in his paper &amp;ldquo;The Non-Conceptual Dimension of Social Mediation: Toward a Materialist Aufhebung of Hegel&amp;rdquo; (2019, International Journal of Philosophical Studies, 27:3), there is a dialectical relationship between the manifest and scientific images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-scientific-image-as-the-negation-of-the-negation&#34;&gt;The scientific image as the negation of the negation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reiterate, capitalist social relations &amp;ldquo;do not appear as direct social relations between persons in their work, but rather as material relations between persons and social relations between things.&amp;rdquo; It is then fair to say that while these relations are objectified, they are nevertheless viewed as &lt;em&gt;person-like&lt;/em&gt;. While the &lt;em&gt;social relations between things&lt;/em&gt; are not &lt;em&gt;mere&lt;/em&gt; appearances, their understanding as objectified Givens nonetheless hinges on treating &lt;em&gt;things&lt;/em&gt; as primarily being subject to the normative descriptions of the manifest image. Therefore, despite being often characterized as a &lt;em&gt;scientific&lt;/em&gt; measure of human activity, it is more apt to describe economics as a predominant manifest image &amp;lsquo;explanation&amp;rsquo; of the world. The &amp;lsquo;facts&amp;rsquo; economics locates and the analysis it undertakes remains locked in the manifest image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite the leeriness one may feel in approaching Sellars&#39; use of the term &amp;lsquo;&lt;em&gt;scientific&lt;/em&gt;&amp;rsquo; in his conception of the scientific image, the critique of capitalism must &lt;em&gt;necessarily&lt;/em&gt; be scientific according to his description &lt;em&gt;in order to be effective&lt;/em&gt;. Like Adorno, Sellars views the necessity of reaching outside the normative constraints of manifest image language-use, to engage in the scientific image, in order to critique and hopefully &lt;em&gt;change&lt;/em&gt; the terms of the manifest image itself. In &lt;em&gt;Capital&lt;/em&gt; Marx does just this. By postulating &amp;lsquo;invisible&amp;rsquo;, but objective phenomena, such as value and fetishism, he is turning the manifest image against itself, locating non-normative forces that drive our normative social practices. In this way, Adorno&amp;rsquo;s critique of capitalism can be seen as an extension and refinement of Marx&amp;rsquo;s project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capitalism&amp;rsquo;s negation of the subject––turning mediated social relations into an apparent Given object––must be negated by appeal to the non-normative and non-conceptual. Paradoxically, this must be done using the linguistic resources of the manifest image itself. Critique is necessarily imminent to social practices of language-use under capitalism. Like any novel use of language––metaphorical language-use or scientifically testing the objectivity of postulated force––there is a necessary risk. The metaphor may not land. A scientific hypothesis may be rejected. And critique may not dissolve the objectified appearance of capitalist social relations. Regardless of these difficulties, we know that erecting a scientific image with the tools of the manifest image is possible. It has been done before. The trick with critique is to continue experimenting and finding ways of clarifying how the appearance of objectified social relations rest upon something else, that this appearance is subject and therefore subject to revision.&lt;/p&gt;
